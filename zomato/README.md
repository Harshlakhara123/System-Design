## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (for build system)
- Standard C++ libraries

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd zomato
   ```

2. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Configure with CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
./zomato
```

The application provides a console-based interface for managing restaurants, users, and orders.

## Architecture

This application follows object-oriented design principles with the following patterns:

- **Factory Pattern**: For creating different types of orders (immediate and scheduled)
- **Strategy Pattern**: For implementing different payment methods
- **Manager Classes**: To handle business logic for orders and restaurants
- **Model Classes**: To represent data entities

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request


## Build Notes

- Check `build_errors.txt` for any compilation issues
- The application uses standard C++ features and should compile on most modern compilers
- For Windows builds, ensure you have Visual Studio or MinGW installed

## Future Enhancements

- GUI interface
- Database integration
- Real-time order tracking
- Mobile app companion
- Advanced search and filtering
- Review and rating system
